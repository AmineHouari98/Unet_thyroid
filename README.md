Ultrasound imaging is a highly recommended medical imaging technique for
diagnosing thyroid nodules, which are among the most common lesions that affect the proper
functioning of the thyroid gland.
Unfortunately, the visual assessment of these nodules is difficult and depends on the
experience of radiologists, for this reason a Computer Aided Diagnosis system has become an
important component in clinical routine. These systems are based on image analysis
algorithms allowing lesion segmentation on digitized images. They are designed specifically
for automatic detection.
In this work, we propose an approach for the detection of thyroid nodules (artificial
vision) in ultrasound images, based on deep learning and more specifically on the fully
convolutional network U-NET. The experimental results, on a set of 466 ultrasound images,
gave an accuracy rate of 95% and an error rate of 11%.
